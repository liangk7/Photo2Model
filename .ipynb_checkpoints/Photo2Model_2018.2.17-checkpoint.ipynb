    "## Motivation\n",
    "With the development of the digital age, an abundance of media in a 2D form have arose (writing, images, videos, etc). But as society progresses further into fields of AI and VR, a massive shift will occur from development in 2D environments to development in 3D environments. Therefore more capable hardware and more advanced software will be required (with some even being prototyped already) to meet these demands. However, to bridge the gap and to discover insights for hardware design, is there a means of **utilizing current 2D hardware and software techniques to devise solutions for the 3D realm**?\n",

    "## Goals\n",
    "* Gather image(s) of an object (from anywhere) and identify its silhouette\n",
    "* Take these understood images and map it into a model representation\n",
    "* Translate this model representation into a 3D environment\n",
